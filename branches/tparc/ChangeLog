Initial release. 

This branch takes Hamlinux and customizes it some more. It is intended to run 
on a PC Engines Alix3 SBC (custom kernel).

It also installs FPAC Amateur Radio Switching Software, along with vim and ntp.

The custom kernel strips out a bunch of stuff we aren't going to use, 
compiles in AMD Geode specific drivers, etc.

A note about using the ALIX 3D3 (built-in VGA). You need to add the boot 
parameter leds-alix2.force=1 to get the on-board LED's to work (they 
are not detected properly on this platform).
